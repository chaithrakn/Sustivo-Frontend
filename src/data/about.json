    "excerpt": "At Sustivo, we are building the largest online travel platform to discover and book the most eco-friendly, responsible hotels and experiences around the world. We believe that we can all make a positive impact on the places that we travel to and the communities that we encounter on these travels. We believe that our oceans, mountains, forests and cities deserve more respect from us as travelers. We believe that travel can be a more fulfiling if we make it a give-and-take activity. Above all, we believe that sustainable travel is possible without giving up on comfort, fun and adventure, whether you are looking for budget-friendliness or luxury.",

    "content": "<h3>Sustivo Values</h3><p> UNWTO describes sustainable travel as <i>\"Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities.\"</i> Our values are based on three pillars: <strong>Environmental impact, Community Championship and Regenerative travel.</strong> </p> <h3>Environmental Impact</h3> <p> Our partner hotels strive hard to make sure that their operations leave a minimum impact on the planet. While some of our partners are Certified Carbon Nuetral, others follow initiatives like below: <ul><li>No Single Use Plastic</li><li>Wast Recycling</li><li>Renewable sources of energy</li><li>Increased energy efficiency</li><li>In-house organic farm </li><li>Use of sustainably sourced food</li></ul></p> <h3>Community Championship</h3> <p> Our partners are on a mission to empower the local communities through innovative initiatives. Many of our partners are locally owned, independent businesses. Other measures in this category include: <ul><li>Partially owned by employees</li><li>Support local NGOs financially</li><li>Promote education of children</li><li>Supports local artisans and businesses</li><li>Hire and educate local talent </li></ul></p> <h3>Regenerative Travel</h3><p> While sustainability is about minimising the negative impacts of travel, regeneration is about creating a positive impact. <strong>Regenerative travel means to give more to the planet and local communities than we take, </strong> to rebuild what has been depleted or destroyed. Our partners are involved in many regeneration projects such as: <ul> <li>Marine conservation</li><li>Forest conservation</li><li>Wildlife protection</li><li>Cleanup activities - ocean or land</li></ul></p>"
